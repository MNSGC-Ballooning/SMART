Servo- HXT500 (the kind from all of the arduino kits)

SMART underfoam: 	1x	1/4"  plywood
SMART servoholder:	1x	1/8"  plywood
SMART body:		1x	1/16" anything (1/16" basswood can be purchased from Rapson shop)
SMART face:		2x	1/8"  plywood
SMART face:		1x	1/4"  plywood

Stack up in this order:
SMART face 1/8"
SMART body
SMART face 1/8"
SMART face 1/4"

this slides into the fat rectangle inside SMART underfoam, with the 1/4" SMART face toward the servo.

The reason for having one side of the main stack much thicker than the other is to keep the pull pin straight even after it is pulled out of the opposite hole.

The pull pins were made from thick thumbtacks, and the connecting pulley going from the servo to the pull pin was made out of thin paperclip material.
